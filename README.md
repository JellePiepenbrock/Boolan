# Boolan

Boolan is a Python package to determine characteristics of Boolean functions. It uses the fact that Boolean functions can be expressed as multilinear polynomials over a two valued field {1, -1}. Transforming the Boolean functions into this polynomial (which is close to a Fourier transform), exposes all kinds of information about the behavior of the function, which can be gleaned from the Fourier coefficients of the polynomial.
